# Customer Churn Prediction Using Decision Tree

This project predicts customer churn using a Decision Tree classifier. By analyzing customer data, it helps businesses identify which customers are likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Decision Tree model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics and visualization

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualization, if used)
- numpy

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ennin-Rashid/Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Decision-Tree.git
   cd Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Decision-Tree
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python <your_main_script.py>
   ```

   Replace `<your_main_script.py>` with the main Python script (e.g., `churn_prediction.py`).

## Project Structure

- `data/` - synthetic Dataset
- `src/` - Source code and modules
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks (if any)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Results

The model provides performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to evaluate churn prediction.
